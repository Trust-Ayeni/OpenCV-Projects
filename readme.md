# SUMMARY
All of these represent fixed number of pixels

VGA = 640*480  has only two colors (black and white) binary colors. 640 pixels in the width and 480 pixels in the height.
HD = 1280*720
FHD = 1920*1080
4K = 3840*2160

colored images has 3 Gray scale image = RGB (red, green and blue), meaning that a colored VGA image is 640*480*3(chanel)
This repository project explains the core concepts of OpenCV

# LIBRARY
The library used are OpenCV, Numpy (for the conversion of pixels into arrays and to allow for the modification of picture)

# INSTALLATIONS
Install PyCharm by downloading the community version because it is free
OR
Install VScode

Download python/Anaconda and add those to your (PyCharm/Anaconda) path.

# OPENCV CONVENTION
In mathematics the positive side of the x-axis is towards east, while the positive side of the y-axis is towards the north.
In OPENCV the x-axis is the same but the y-axis is towards the south

To understand it further, consider an image 640*480: 640 at x-axis and 480 at y-axis with origin (0,0) and with max origin at (640,480).
