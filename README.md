# OpenCV Projects ðŸ“·
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It is used for a range of image and video processing applications, including object detection, face recognition, and motion tracking. Here are some cool OpenCV projects to try out:

### Real-time Face Detection ðŸ‘¤
This project involves using OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using your computer's webcam. You can add extra features like drawing a rectangle around the detected face, adding text labels, or even detecting emotions based on facial expressions.

### Object Tracking ðŸŽ¯ SOON
Object tracking is a popular application of computer vision that involves identifying and tracking objects in a video stream. This project involves using OpenCV to track a specific object in a video stream, like a person or a car.

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR) ðŸ“‘
OCR is a technology that allows computers to recognize text within digital images. This project involves using OpenCV to preprocess an image and then using OCR software to extract text from the image.

#### LIBRARY
The library used are OpenCV, Numpy (for the conversion of pixels into arrays and to allow for the modification of picture)

#### INSTALLATIONS
Install PyCharm by downloading the community version because it is free OR Install VScode

Download python/Anaconda and add those to your (PyCharm/Anaconda) path.

#### OPENCV CONVENTION
In mathematics the positive side of the x-axis is towards east, while the positive side of the y-axis is towards the north. In OPENCV the x-axis is the same but the y-axis is towards the south

To understand it further, consider an image 640*480: 640 at x-axis and 480 at y-axis with origin (0,0) and with max origin at (640,480).
